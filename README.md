# WOC7015-week10
 This project aims to classify sentiment in text data using various machine learning algorithms. Using a Kaggle dataset of positive and negative test cases, we implement and compare models including K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression to evaluate their performance.
# Text Classification Model Comparison

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify sentiment in text data using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of labeled positive and negative test cases, sourced from Kaggle. We implement multiple models to evaluate their performance in sentiment classification.

## Algorithms Used
The following algorithms were implemented:
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors** (KNN) - *This algorithm is different from those discussed in the video.*

## Installation
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Kaggle Notebook
