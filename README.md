 This project aims to classify sentiment in text data using various machine learning algorithms. Using a Kaggle dataset of positive and negative test cases, we implement and compare models including K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression to evaluate their performance.
